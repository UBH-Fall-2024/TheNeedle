1. Political News Generator

*** NEW IDEAS ***

Have user input url and use some data analysis to identify if it is more left or more right using key left or right words and calcuate
the chance of it being one way or the other

Ai prompt with layout

Prompt: 
One idea we have is make a website that a user can type a political idea or political topic and it will gather sources from web that pulls 
far left sources and far right sources and nuetral sources and use ai to generate a overall idea of the topic from the sources. 

Response:

User Interface (UI) for Input:
Build a simple webpage where users can type in a political topic or keyword.
Use a form submission to trigger a backend process that gathers and analyzes the information.

Web Scraping and News Aggregation:
Sources: Use news APIs (such as Bing News API, NewsAPI, or GDELT) to gather articles. Some APIs allow you to filter sources by political leaning,
but you may also need to build a list of known sources by bias (left, right, neutral).

Categorize by Bias, Create three categories: 
left-leaning, right-leaning, and neutral sources. The AllSides Bias Ratings website offers a 
comprehensive list that categorizes major news outlets.
Sentiment and Source Categorization: For extra refinement, you can use basic keyword matching or sentiment analysis tools (like VADER or TextBlob)
to help classify the sentiment in articles to support your bias categories.

Summarization with AI:
Once articles are categorized, use an AI-based summarization tool to create summaries for each category:
Far Left Summary
Far Right Summary
Neutral Summary
Tools for Summarization: Use OpenAI's GPT or Hugging Face models for summarization. Use separate prompts or models for each category so you can better control how it interacts with the content.

Generate an Overall Summary and Displaying the Output:
Present the left, right, and neutral summaries on the web page along with the overall summary.
Optionally, display links to the original articles for users who want to explore further.

Technology Stack:
Frontend: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, with a framework like React for smoother UI interactions.
Backend: Flask or Django for a quick setup, handling API calls and processing.

APIs/Services:
NewsAPI, GDELT, or Bing News API for sourcing news articles.
OpenAI GPT or Hugging Face Summarization Models for AI-generated summaries.
VADER or TextBlob for quick sentiment analysis (if desired for classification).
Storage: Firebase or SQLite to save recent searches or cache data if needed.

Challenges and Tips
Rate Limits: News APIs often have rate limits, so limit queries for each search.
Summarization Time: Summarizing multiple sources may slow down response time, so start by summarizing only a few articles per bias category for each query.
Data Quality: Ensure sources selected by bias are reputable to avoid promoting misinformation; stick with well-known outlets.
Potential Enhancements
Interactive Graph: Display a visual bias chart showing the distribution of sentiment/bias across sources.
User Feedback: Allow users to provide feedback on summaries, helping refine results and tune for bias detection.
Trending Topics: Auto-suggest trending political topics based on recent queries or popular keywords.
